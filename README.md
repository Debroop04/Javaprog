# Some Calculators

Currently I am mainly making Java projects(including GUI stuff).
This contains all sorts of Calculators and can be classified as beginner level projects.
I have also put the codes for the same.
Hopefully it helps some of you in making a project for yourself

## Calculator(Advanced)

This is a calculator that, along with performing basic arithmetic functions<br>
performs other different functions such as factorials,permutations,combinations etc

### What it can do
- Factorials
- Permutations
- Combinations
- Logarithms

## Quadratic equation Calculator

This calculator takes in coefficients a,b,c of the form axÂ² + bx + c and then<br> 
calculates the roots of the equations accordingly and displays them. A special feature that<br>
I added to enhance the UI a little bit was the availibility of dark/light modes!<br>

### Features
- Light/Dark mode<br><br><br>
